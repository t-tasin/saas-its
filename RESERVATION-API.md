## üîÑ Reservation Workflow

1. **User Creates Reservation** (Public/Authenticated)
   - Status: `pending`
   - Equipment not yet assigned

2. **Operator Reviews & Approves** (Operator/Admin)
   - Assigns specific assets to items
   - Status: `approved`

3. **User Picks Up Equipment** (Operator marks as active)
   - Status: `active`
   - Equipment in use

4. **User Returns Equipment** (Operator marks as returned)
   - Status: `returned`
   - Assets available again

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Denial**: Operator denies request ‚Üí Status: `denied`
- **Cancellation**: User/Operator cancels pending ‚Üí Status: `cancelled`

## üìä Reservation Statuses

| Status | Description | Who Can Set |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `pending` | Initial state | System (on creation) |
| `approved` | Approved, assets assigned | Operator/Admin |
| `denied` | Request denied | Operator/Admin |
| `active` | Equipment picked up | Operator/Admin |
| `returned` | Equipment returned | Operator/Admin |
| `cancelled` | Reservation cancelled | User (own pending) / Operator/Admin |

## üéØ Integration Notes

### For Frontend Developers

1. **Equipment Catalog**: Fetch from `/v1/availability` to show available equipment types
2. **Reservation Form**: Use asset type IDs from availability endpoint
3. **User Flow**: 
   - General users: Can create and view their own reservations
   - Operators: Can view all, approve/deny, activate, return
   - Admins: Full control including deletions

### Data Synchronization

The Reservation Service maintains a snapshot of equipment availability:
- `EquipmentAvailability` table stores current counts
- Should sync with Asset Service for real-time updates
- Currently uses seed data for testing

### Future Enhancements

- Real-time sync with Asset Service
- Email notifications on status changes
- Calendar integration for availability
- Conflict detection and automatic suggestions
- Equipment maintenance scheduling
