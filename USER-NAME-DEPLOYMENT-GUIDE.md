# User Name Field - Deployment Guide

## üö® IMPORTANT: Breaking Change

The `name` field in the `User` model is now **required** (non-nullable). You must follow these steps **IN ORDER** before deploying the updated identity service.

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Update Existing Users in Neon Database**

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO THIS FIRST - Before deploying to Railway!**

1. **Open your Neon SQL Editor**
2. **Run the SQL from `infra/sql/UPDATE-USER-NAMES.sql`**:

```sql
-- Set search path to identity schema
SET search_path TO identity;

-- Check current users with null names
SELECT id, email, name, role 
FROM "User" 
WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Update users with null names to have a default name based on email
UPDATE "User"
SET name = INITCAP(SPLIT_PART(email, '@', 1))
WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Verify all users now have names (should return 0 rows)
SELECT id, email, name, role 
FROM "User" 
WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Check all users to confirm
SELECT email, name, role 
FROM "User" 
ORDER BY "createdAt";
```

3. **Verify**: The last query should show all users with names (no null values)

---

### **Step 2: Deploy to Railway**

Once all existing users have names, the updated service will deploy successfully.

**Railway will automatically redeploy** when you push to GitHub (if you have GitHub integration enabled).

**Or manually trigger a redeploy** in Railway dashboard.

---

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**

Test that the changes are live:

```bash
# Check a user to see the name field
curl -s "https://saas-itsidentity-svc-production.up.railway.app/v1/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test" | jq '.users[0]'
```

‚úÖ **Success**: All users should have `"name"` with a value (not null)

---

## üéØ What Changed

### **Backend Changes:**
1. **Prisma Schema**: `name String?` ‚Üí `name String` (non-nullable)
2. **DTOs**: `name` is now required in `RegisterDto` and `CreateUserDto`
3. **Validation**: Added `@MinLength(1)` to ensure name is not empty
4. **MultiSchema Support**: Added `@@schema("identity")` for Neon schema isolation

### **Frontend Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Registration forms must now include a name field
- ‚úÖ Ticket assignment now shows user names instead of emails
- ‚úÖ User display across the app will use names

---

## üîß For New Users

All new users **must** provide a name during registration:

**Example Registration Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "newuser@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "name": "John Doe"  // ‚Üê NOW REQUIRED
}
```

---

## üí° Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users see "John Doe" instead of "john.doe@example.com"
2. **Ticket Assignment**: Assigned tickets show operator names clearly
3. **Professional**: Proper user identification throughout the app

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Column 'name' cannot be null" error on deployment
- **Solution**: You didn't run Step 1 first. Run the UPDATE-USER-NAMES.sql script in Neon

### Issue: Registration fails with "name is required"
- **Solution**: Update your frontend registration forms to include a name field

### Issue: Railway build fails with Prisma validation errors
- **Solution**: Make sure you've pushed the latest changes to GitHub and Railway has pulled them

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

After completing these steps:
1. ‚úÖ All existing users have names
2. ‚úÖ Identity service deployed with name requirement
3. ‚úÖ New users must provide names during registration
4. ‚úÖ Ticket assignments show user names

Your SaaS ITS now has proper user identification! üéâ
