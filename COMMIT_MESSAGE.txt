feat: Production-ready Railway deployment with complete microservices infrastructure

This commit represents the complete production-ready deployment of the SaaS ITS 
platform with 4 microservices, AWS S3 integration, and comprehensive documentation.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
- ✅ 4 microservices (Identity, Ticket, Asset, Reservation) ready for Railway
- ✅ Docker multi-stage builds optimized for production
- ✅ AWS S3 integration for ticket attachments (saas-its-ticket-attachments)
- ✅ JWT authentication with OTP email verification (SendGrid)
- ✅ Two-factor authentication for operators/admins
- ✅ Multi-tenant PostgreSQL database (Neon) with 4 schemas
- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - 3 roles
- ✅ 40+ REST API endpoints across all services
- ✅ Comprehensive asset tracking (25+ fields)
- ✅ Equipment reservation workflow with approval system
- ✅ Auto-deploy CI/CD via Railway

BACKEND SERVICES:
- Identity Service (Port 3000): Auth, JWT, OTP, user management
- Ticket Service (Port 3002): Tickets, comments, S3 attachments, categories
- Asset Service (Port 3003): Asset tracking, assignments, lifecycle management
- Reservation Service (Port 5003): Equipment reservations, approval workflow

CONFIGURATION:
- Updated .gitignore to exclude documentation and secrets
- Created public README.md for GitHub
- Railway environment templates configured
- S3 bucket: saas-its-ticket-attachments
- Neon PostgreSQL with schema-based multi-tenancy
- SendGrid SMTP for OTP emails

DEPLOYMENT READY:
- All Dockerfiles optimized and tested
- Railway auto-deploy configured
- Environment variables templated
- Health checks implemented
- Zero-downtime deployment support
- HTTPS/SSL auto-configured

DOCUMENTATION (Local only, not in Git):
- Complete API reference for frontend integration
- Railway deployment guides (quick & detailed)
- CI/CD configuration checklist
- Frontend integration guide with code examples
- Testing guides and checklists

SECURITY:
- Secrets management via Railway environment variables
- JWT token-based authentication
- OTP verification via email
- RBAC authorization
- Input validation with class-validator
- SQL injection protection (Prisma ORM)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Asset schema redesigned (assetTag → assetId, 25+ fields added)
- Reservation model simplified (flattened from items array)
- Authentication requires OTP verification (no direct JWT on login)

NEXT STEPS:
- Deploy to Railway (15 minutes, follow RAILWAY-QUICK-SETUP.md)
- Share FRONTEND-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md with frontend team
- Configure production URLs in frontend environment

TECH STACK:
Backend: NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL
Cloud: Railway, AWS S3, Neon PostgreSQL, SendGrid
DevOps: Docker, Git, CI/CD auto-deploy

METRICS:
- 4 microservices
- 40+ API endpoints
- 25+ asset tracking fields
- 3 user roles (RBAC)
- 100% TypeScript
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Auto-scaling ready

Deployment cost: $20-40/month (Railway + free tiers for Neon, S3, SendGrid)
