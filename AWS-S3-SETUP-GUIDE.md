# AWS S3 Setup Guide for Ticket Attachments

## üö® Current Status
Your ticket service is currently using **LocalStack** (local S3 mock) instead of real AWS S3. This is why attachment URLs point to `http://localstack:4566/`.

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do

### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket in AWS**

1. **Log into AWS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. **Create a new bucket**:
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Bucket name: `saas-its-ticket-attachments` (or your preferred name)
   - Region: `us-east-1` (or your preferred region)
   - **Block all public access**: ‚úÖ Enable (we'll use presigned URLs)
   - Click "Create bucket"

### **Step 2: Create IAM User with S3 Access**

1. **Go to IAM Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. **Create a new user**:
   - Click "Users" ‚Üí "Create user"
   - Username: `saas-its-backend`
   - Click "Next"
3. **Set permissions**:
   - Select "Attach policies directly"
   - Search and select: **`AmazonS3FullAccess`** (or create a custom policy with only your bucket)
   - Click "Next" ‚Üí "Create user"
4. **Create Access Keys**:
   - Click on the newly created user
   - Go to "Security credentials" tab
   - Click "Create access key"
   - Select "Application running outside AWS"
   - Click "Next" ‚Üí "Create access key"
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è SAVE THESE CREDENTIALS (you won't see them again)**:
     - `Access key ID`: e.g., `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`
     - `Secret access key`: e.g., `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

### **Step 3: Configure Railway Environment Variables**

Go to your **Railway ticket-svc service** and add these environment variables:

```bash
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id-from-step-2>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key-from-step-2>
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=saas-its-ticket-attachments

# Make sure NODE_ENV is set to production (this disables LocalStack)
NODE_ENV=production
```

**To add these in Railway:**
1. Open your Railway project
2. Select the `ticket-svc` service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Click "+ New Variable"
5. Add each variable above
6. Click "Deploy" to restart the service

### **Step 4: Verify S3 Integration**

After Railway redeploys, test the attachment upload URL generation:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://saas-itsticket-svc-production.up.railway.app/v1/tickets/<ticket-id>/attachments/upload-url" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename": "test.txt", "contentType": "text/plain"}'
```

‚úÖ **Success**: The URL should start with `https://saas-its-ticket-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/` or `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`

‚ùå **Still LocalStack**: The URL still shows `http://localstack:4566/` - check that `NODE_ENV=production` is set

## üìã Optional: Create a Custom IAM Policy (More Secure)

Instead of `AmazonS3FullAccess`, create a custom policy with least privilege:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::saas-its-ticket-attachments",
        "arn:aws:s3:::saas-its-ticket-attachments/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## üîß Testing After Setup

Once configured, test the full flow:

1. **Create a ticket** with an attachment in your frontend
2. **Check the backend response** - it should include attachment metadata
3. **Download the attachment** - the download URL should work
4. **Verify in AWS Console** - go to your S3 bucket and check that files are being uploaded to `tickets/<ticket-id>/<attachment-id>/`

---

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

- **S3 Storage**: ~$0.023 per GB/month
- **S3 Requests**: ~$0.005 per 1,000 PUT requests
- **Data Transfer**: First 1GB free per month, then ~$0.09 per GB

For a typical SaaS with moderate attachment usage (~10GB storage, 10k uploads/month):
- **Estimated cost**: ~$0.50 - $2.00 per month

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access Denied" errors
- **Solution**: Check IAM user has correct S3 permissions
- Verify bucket name matches the `S3_BUCKET_NAME` env var

### Issue: "Bucket does not exist"
- **Solution**: Make sure you created the bucket in the same region as `AWS_REGION`

### Issue: Still seeing LocalStack URLs
- **Solution**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` in Railway
- Redeploy the service

## ‚úÖ Summary

After completing these steps:
1. ‚úÖ S3 bucket created
2. ‚úÖ IAM user with S3 access created
3. ‚úÖ Railway environment variables configured
4. ‚úÖ Service redeployed
5. ‚úÖ Attachment uploads working with real AWS S3

Your ticket attachments will now be stored securely in AWS S3 with presigned URLs for upload and download! üéâ
